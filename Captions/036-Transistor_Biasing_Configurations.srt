00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,080
Hi

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,682
and welcome to the November edition of

3
00:00:03,782 --> 00:00:04,846
According to Pete

4
00:00:04,946 --> 00:00:06,839
Today we're gonna cover

5
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,902
uh,transistor biasing configurations

6
00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:13,342
which is probably kind of a wacky thing.

7
00:00:13,442 --> 00:00:15,121
I had originally thought that, uh,

8
00:00:15,221 --> 00:00:18,140
hey I'm gonna do MOSFET biasing circuits that'll be cool

9
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,906
and then I figured out I don't know anything

10
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:21,829
about MOSFET biasing circuits.

11
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:22,612
Yet.

12
00:00:22,612 --> 00:00:24,291
But instead I'm gonna back up a little bit

13
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,042
and do transistor biasing
and I thought

14
00:00:26,142 --> 00:00:28,001
great, I can cover
, uh, common base

15
00:00:28,101 --> 00:00:31,672
and common collector and
common emitter in one big...

16
00:00:31,772 --> 00:00:33,242
No you can't do this

17
00:00:33,342 --> 00:00:34,793
I fear that's insanity

18
00:00:34,893 --> 00:00:36,530
so today I'm going to cover

19
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,170
uh, common base configuration
which honestly is

20
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,410
very rarely used, and common
emitter configuration which is

21
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:46,448
more often use but not as much

22
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:49,467
as the third one that we're gonna
do later, called common emitter

23
00:00:49,978 --> 00:00:53,635
so for the, uh, the case
of, uh, of for for

24
00:00:53,635 --> 00:00:55,870
for the sake of argument
for the sake of our examples

25
00:00:55,869 --> 00:01:00,030
we're going to talk about standard
small-signal NPN transistor

26
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,406
remember this guy, points to
the N material, so NPN

27
00:01:05,508 --> 00:01:07,769
Imagine this to be
your standard garden variety

28
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:13,188
2N3904, we all know 'em,
we all love 'em

29
00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:15,178
if you will recall,
little bit a review,

30
00:01:15,278 --> 00:01:20,935
you get a small current
going from base

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,067
to emitter and that gives you a
large current

32
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:29,150
[lip buzzing sound]

33
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,579
that goes from

34
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,412
emitter or collector to emitter.
Okay?

35
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,252
So, the proportion, there's a proportion

36
00:01:38,352 --> 00:01:40,790
for how big this current is to
the how big this current is

37
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,033
and that is called, you look on a datasheet

38
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:47,140
 hfe

39
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,159
or Beta, Okay?

40
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,649
and that number for to 2N3904

41
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,075
is something on the order of
100 to 300

42
00:01:57,175 --> 00:01:59,784
depending on where you have the transistor biased

43
00:01:59,884 --> 00:02:02,109
The, the idea is like, so

44
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:05,489
one micro amp through the base emitter junction

45
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:08,361
will give you, um, what?

46
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,420
10 milliamps at a factor of a hundred

47
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,280
going from collector to emitter the
first thing you got to do before

48
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,116
before anything else can happen you

49
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:18,214
gotta turn the transistor on

50
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:19,965
you get a small current going through here

51
00:02:20,065 --> 00:02:22,199
you get a large current going
through here. Right?

52
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:26,975
Which means setting it up with a
DC quiescent state, right?

53
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:30,340
The reason we want to use
this thing is to pass an AC signal

54
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,271
could be audio,
could be RF,

55
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:34,889
could be a sensor,
could be a lot of different things.

56
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:38,089
In general, what you do, is you set up

57
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,819
this voltage divider, R1 and R2
so that you have

58
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:46,689
a known voltage here which for the
sake of argument will just say is

59
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:51,275
Vd+  over 2 which it's not
necessarily ever going to be

60
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:53,370
but it's good for for starting someplace, right?

61
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,340
Now, um, for this being a 2N3904

62
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,967
you can expect, right, this is a diode.

63
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:02,269
Right? We talked about that in the previous

64
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:05,322
You don't remember some stuff, go
back to the transistors episode

65
00:03:05,322 --> 00:03:07,560
that was way long ago and
review some of this

66
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,789
Okay? This is a diode, and you
gotta turn guy this on

67
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:15,359
and you can assume, "assume"
that this is about

68
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,622
0.6 volts dropped from here to here.

69
00:03:19,722 --> 00:03:21,530
So if you know you've got

70
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,519
V-plus over two, half of VCC,
then you know

71
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,140
you would know that you've
got 0.6 volts

72
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:30,784
less than that here.

73
00:03:30,884 --> 00:03:35,083
If V+ was 10 volts
(which you totally cannot read) 

74
00:03:35,183 --> 00:03:39,840
10 Volts, and then that makes this
5 Volts and that makes this

75
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,639
4.4 Volts. Okay? 4.4 Volts.

76
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,150
You set up your emitter collector
current

77
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,599
with that resistor, alright?
You know you got 4.4 Volts here

78
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,620
and in the process of designing the
circuit and we'll get the some of that

79
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,771
be cool,

80
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,759
you calculate this value

81
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,179
to give you your current through
emitter to collector

82
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,775
using Ohms Law, okay?

83
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:09,471
So if I wanted 5 milliamps going
through here I would say

84
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:12,479
okay 4.4 both divided by 5 milliamps is

85
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,039
X Ohms, and I would set that value to be

86
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,500
X Ohms, and then these are just a
resistor divider

87
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,519
but their values can become critical
depending on the application

88
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:27,145
and this will become clearer as I go.

89
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:28,498
This guy

90
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:31,590
is typically used for setting up

91
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:33,885
a , um, an operating point

92
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:35,650
or limiting current through this thing

93
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,736
and that'll become clearer...
I keep saying that, right?

94
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:40,500
 General concepts right now.

95
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,070
First thing you wanna do is
turn it on with regard to DC,

96
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,509
and this is what we're doing,
we setup our divider

97
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:47,436
we figure out our voltage here,

98
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:49,450
we figure out how much current is here

99
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,358
and these are all going to be iterative

100
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,241
When you're working with stuff like this

101
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:56,800
this is not an exact science. Alright

102
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,583
This is an iterative process.  Um,

103
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:03,885
If you've been watching my shows
for all this time and you think

104
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:06,955
that electronics is a precise thing

105
00:05:07,055 --> 00:05:10,755
you've been not
paying attention brother or sister

106
00:05:10,855 --> 00:05:13,418
Um, this is, this is iterative

107
00:05:13,518 --> 00:05:14,464
it-er-a-tive

108
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,969
and always plan for it to be
because it's never gonna come out

109
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:18,851
just perfect.

110
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,432
Now the first configuration
I'm gonna talk about is called

111
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:22,455
common base

112
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:26,610
Um, and I start with this on because
it's the the "low-key one?"

113
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,660
It's probably not low key at all,
but it's the one that is,

114
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,313
uh, least commonly used,
so call it uncommon base. 

115
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:37,200
you put an input on the emitter

116
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,970
which is unusual, and you take your
output from the collector

117
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:41,993
which is not unusual.

118
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:44,653
The input impedance, right,

119
00:05:44,753 --> 00:05:47,589
so the amount of current that
this circuit is gonna try to draw

120
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:51,598
off of the source, it'll try to draw
all of the current.

121
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:53,520
the input impedances are very low.

122
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,334
Okay? Um, like on the order of
less than 10 Ohms typically.

123
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:02,723
and the output impedance is rather high

124
00:06:02,823 --> 00:06:07,759
 I'm in fact, it is said that the source

125
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,920
the source impedance, [stumbling]
or the source current, uh,

126
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,885
is carried all the way to the output,

127
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:17,046
and in fact your Z out is approximated by R source

128
00:06:17,146 --> 00:06:20,761
whatever this's internal resistance is, um,

129
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:24,617
divided by the beta of the transistor.

130
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:29,790
So it's not a great thing, its current
gain is a little bit less than 1

131
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,353
its voltage gain can be quite high.

132
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:37,110
Problem is, the voltage gain is
difficult to calculate

133
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,460
and is highly dependent on the thermal voltage

134
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:45,719
of the device. Oh my gosh!
Go look up Boltzmann constant.

135
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,959
The gain is unpredictable,

136
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:50,570
the current gain is terrible,

137
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:53,661
and the input impedance, sucks.

138
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:57,450
So for that reason this configuration is generally relegated to things

139
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:01,019
like the front end of a radio, were you're trying to match

140
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:02,780
the impedance of an antenna.

141
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,242
This is terrible at low frequencies and the reason is because

142
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,850
because the input impedance is only a few Ohms

143
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,970
now remember this reef, this this equation:

144
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:19,025
1/(2*pi*R*C),

145
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:24,409
that, is, f, that's your corner frequency

146
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,304
for this input impedance and that
capacitor

147
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:30,363
so you gonna try to calculate that
capacitor based on that.

148
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:32,540
and a lower the frequency is

149
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,529
and the lower that resistance is

150
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:39,319
the more awful that cap is going to become.

151
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:42,670
So at low frequencies this thing is
just about completely unworkable

152
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,370
what I know, is that this circuit is
used for voltage gain.

153
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:46,669
Okay? 

154
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:50,439
So I'm going to have a large swing
on the output which is at the collector

155
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:53,610
now, the first thing, is I go "Ahh!"

156
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,325
my supply voltage is 10 Volts,

157
00:07:55,425 --> 00:08:00,310
so I want my quiescent operating
point of my output

158
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:07,254
to be at half at that, Okay? So I
know this is going to be 5 Volts

159
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:10,490
not even close to writing, hurray.

160
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,050
5 Volts. Okay, that's a choice,
that is

161
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,879
that is something, I want
my output to be able to swing

162
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,499
up to 10 and down to 0 as cleanly as possible so I set that there.

163
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:26,629
I know that this will this has to
be less than that

164
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:30,089
I don't know how much but, mmmm

165
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:32,485
Since I've never set one of these up I took a guess, Right?

166
00:08:32,485 --> 00:08:33,949
I just wanna see where it ends up

167
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,060
So I set this value

168
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,168
to 2 Volts. I also know

169
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:46,253
that the input impedance is is or the inputs, the R in if you will

170
00:08:46,353 --> 00:08:52,620
is going to be the thermal voltage divided by the...

171
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,249
I'll just write it down.

172
00:08:55,349 --> 00:08:58,216
Rin (I hope you can read this a little bit)

173
00:08:58,316 --> 00:09:06,064
equals Vt over Ie,
Ie is the emitter current

174
00:09:06,164 --> 00:09:10,889
Okay? Vt is the thermal voltage and if you look this up

175
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:14,736
it is highly dependent on the temperature of the junction.

176
00:09:14,836 --> 00:09:17,379
Okay? At room temperature the thermal voltage

177
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:20,779
is about 20... s... Wow does this suck!

178
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:24,844
26 millivolt. Okay? It's a small number.

179
00:09:24,944 --> 00:09:27,789
If I just choose a value and for the sake of my example

180
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:30,437
I just chose a value, because I wanted to see what would come out

181
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:34,879
and I chose it to be 5 milliamp

182
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,549
with that value at room temperature

183
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:42,279
Rin comes out to be 5.2 Ohms.

184
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:45,659
Ha ha, that's nuts. More importantly

185
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:49,569
um, with my choice of that, my choice of 2 Volts

186
00:09:49,570 --> 00:10:00,003
I know that 2 Volts divided by 5 milliamps is going to be 400 Ohms

187
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:02,551
for the value of a Re, R emitter

188
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:07,509
Now I also know that since I've chosen my quiescent points

189
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:11,840
to be at 5 Volts till I get maximum
upswing and maximum downswing

190
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:17,872
at 5 milliamps I have a value of 1K

191
00:10:17,972 --> 00:10:21,439
for my Rc, which is resistor collector

192
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,850
this is to collect a resistor, resistor collector, I collect resistors

193
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,710
so I got values for this, I got value for this, I know that's 2 Volts

194
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:33,466
and I assume that this point is going to be 2.6 Volts.

195
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,360
Okay? Because we know that the voltage drop across this

196
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,340
from base to emitter is about 0.6 Volts. Now that's not a guarantee

197
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,389
that's an assumption it could be anywhere from

198
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:49,986
0.55 up to 0.75, and it's gonna depend on device to device.

199
00:10:50,086 --> 00:10:53,726
From there I just gotta set up my divider for 2.6 Volts.

200
00:10:53,826 --> 00:10:56,220
How much current has to go through this divider?

201
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,208
that is a little bit of a critical question.

202
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:00,539
When you set these guys up

203
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,299
and this goes for any these configurations we're gonna talk about

204
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:07,469
you generally want your

205
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,070
your divider current, which goes neh, neh ,neh,

206
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,530
to be a factor of 10

207
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:18,139
more than the current that you know is going through here

208
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:22,387
Okay? So if I've chosen 5 milliamps to go through here

209
00:11:22,387 --> 00:11:24,259
and I know the beta of the transistor

210
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:28,610
which is also variable, but if I assume it to be

211
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,659
100 for small signal device like this, that's not a bad assumption

212
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:36,049
I can assume that, you know, if I got 5 milliamps here

213
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:41,743
I've got 50 microamps that's going this way, okay?

214
00:11:41,843 --> 00:11:47,250
so I want a factor of 10, so, like 500 microamps going here

215
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,632
Now for the sake of my example, I didn't do that,

216
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:52,110
I swamped the heck out of it

217
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:56,220
and I just said "yeah I make that 5 milliamps too,shure what the heck"

218
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,090
5 milliamps, and so it now it's just a matter calculating resistor values

219
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:07,338
Okay? So for R2 down here I got 520 Ohms

220
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:12,840
and for R1 up here I got 1480

221
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,230
now you're going to calculate all kinds values that are not particularly standard.

222
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,214
Okay? So you're gonna have to make the choice

223
00:12:18,314 --> 00:12:19,870
am I going to create a resistor

224
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,420
am I going to make do with what I can get my hands on.

225
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:27,396
Let's talk about a how we expect it to work, right?

226
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:30,995
So if you've got an input here, and I always encourage

227
00:12:30,995 --> 00:12:34,405
like, a mechanical understanding what you're actually looking at.

228
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:38,069
So you're putting in a signal at Vin.

229
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,850
Right? So there's an instantaneous
voltage that occurs at this point

230
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,905
because for that cap, signal, that that's a short, right?

231
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:46,102
so you can expect, you know,

232
00:12:46,102 --> 00:12:49,185
signals going to appear there and that's not even going to be in the circuit

233
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,639
So, with that if your Vin

234
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,960
is going low, what's going to happen here?

235
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,370
its gonna pull this point low and since the base is stable

236
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,419
its gonna turn that sucker on, really hard, right?

237
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:07,324
so when this guy turns on much much harder

238
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:09,346
it becomes a smaller resistance, right?

239
00:13:09,446 --> 00:13:12,762
so it's gonna bring this value down,

240
00:13:12,862 --> 00:13:14,669
so the outputs gonna go down

241
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:18,738
Now when you send the input high, just the opposite

242
00:13:18,738 --> 00:13:20,539
its gonna bring this point higher

243
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:25,549
and its gonna shut of the transistor because your base is held at 2.6 Volts. Right?

244
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:30,439
so this becomes a larger resistor, and so you're gonna have

245
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,540
a positive going signal.

246
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,640
so what this tells us is that your input and output are in phase.

247
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:42,720
my input impedance for my choice of emitter current is 5.2 Ohms.

248
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,052
that is not very good.

249
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:50,330
It may occur to the viewer that in fact the input impedance

250
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:55,502
is not just this but it is this and this. Right? Well, OK,

251
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,300
first thing, point out

252
00:13:57,299 --> 00:13:59,784
these resistors are'nt even going to enter into the equation

253
00:13:59,784 --> 00:14:01,889
 and reason is because I that cap right there

254
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:03,683
because that's an AC ground, okay? 

255
00:14:03,783 --> 00:14:08,523
So these resistors it's not really very critical what their

256
00:14:08,523 --> 00:14:12,920
values are necessarily, unless this is like, 

257
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,153
you know depending on how much branch current you want

258
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:16,912
through here you increase their values

259
00:14:17,012 --> 00:14:19,659
but they're not going to come into the input impedance equation

260
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,750
because that is single ground, okay?

261
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,389
this guy, this guy will also not come into it because

262
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:29,853
he is two orders of magnitude above what we're looking at

263
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:32,279
so that's not gonna come into the equation either

264
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,630
so it's basically going to be that.

265
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:40,620
Now I can improve that, right, if I chose this resistor value

266
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,179
right? still 2 Volts but if I chose the

267
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:48,232
chose this to not past 5 milliamps but to pass 1 milliamps

268
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:51,029
 for example I could increase that

269
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:55,000
by a factor of five. Still not great but it's better.

270
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
the voltage gain of this circuit is not very easily predicted

271
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,371
and its highly dependent on the value of emitter current

272
00:15:06,371 --> 00:15:08,950
the greater your emitter current

273
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:13,721
the greater voltage gain,
the lower your input impedance.

274
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:18,199
This is called the emitter follower,
or common collector.

275
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:22,423
 the idea here is that you put a signal in on the base

276
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:25,920
and you take the output at the emitter

277
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,216
So the emitter follows the base.

278
00:15:30,216 --> 00:15:33,060
The characteristics of this circuit are

279
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:37,937
a high, relatively speaking, a high Zin, input impedance,

280
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,838
and a relatively low output impedance.

281
00:15:40,838 --> 00:15:43,140
So it's a current driver, okay?

282
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:48,149
now because this voltage follows this voltage

283
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:50,834
your voltage gain is going to be just slightly less than 1.

284
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:51,870
 Now you notice

285
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,313
there is no resistor or collector resistor here

286
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:59,850
and that's to facilitate lots and lots of current going to your load,

287
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,990
ultimately. If you put a high going signal on the inputs

288
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,600
you know this point has to be within 0.6 Volts

289
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,867
of that, right, so if you put something in here

290
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:11,570
this is going to be 0.6 under it.

291
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,524
so you're gonna have a high going there

292
00:16:13,524 --> 00:16:17,129
so your input and output are in phase, just like the common base

293
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:21,761
I assigned myself a value of VCC to be 9 Volts

294
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:24,690
because I don't want to make anything easy by making it 10 Volts again

295
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,490
if I know my output signal is here and I know

296
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,279
that I want it to be halfway between VCC and ground

297
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:36,541
then I know that this is 4.5 Volts.

298
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:40,110
Okay? I know that points going to be 4.5 Volts

299
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:45,556
and, because I know that, I know this point is gonna be 5.1 Volts

300
00:16:45,556 --> 00:16:48,842
We want to choose a quiescent current

301
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,285
which is, you know,

302
00:16:50,285 --> 00:16:52,324
 the current that its gonna have running through it

303
00:16:52,424 --> 00:16:55,020
with no input signal, and we want to choose it to be

304
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,370
sorta low. And the reason we wanna to be sorta low

305
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,100
is because we want this transistor to be able to source all of its

306
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,887
extra current through the load,

307
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:07,289
we don't want it going this way, we want it going that way

308
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:12,862
I chose this value, again, to be 5 milliamps.

309
00:17:12,862 --> 00:17:15,480
So if I've got 5 milliamps going this way

310
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,478
and I know I've got 4.5 Volts here then I immediately know that

311
00:17:19,478 --> 00:17:22,299
my value for Re, down there

312
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:27,140
is going to be 900 Ohms.

313
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,220
Now, choosing values for these guys same rule

314
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,259
as with the common base which is to say that

315
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:36,519
whatever your base emitter current is

316
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:40,321
you want your branch current here to be like a factor 10 above that

317
00:17:40,321 --> 00:17:42,089
to swamp out the effects of that thing.

318
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:48,329
so if I've got 5 milliamps here and I assume a beta of about a hundred

319
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:52,099
then I've got 50 microamps going yay wise

320
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:57,259
50 microamps, and a factor 10 or that is 500 microamps.

321
00:17:57,259 --> 00:18:00,379
but, me being me, I just chose a value

322
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,291
and I said it was 2 milliamps.

323
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:07,279
To set up 5.1 Volts at 2 milliamps, the numbers I got

324
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,420
were are 2250

325
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:14,250
no that's going to be really picky, 2250 Ohms for R2

326
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:19,892
and for R1 I got 1950 Ohms.

327
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:22,699
As I was saying before the input impedance

328
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,930
on this circuit, in general, is considered relatively high

329
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:31,029
To calculated how to completely what you're looking at

330
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:34,809
Right? A signal going here is going to be actually

331
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:38,769
this resistor R1 in parallel with R2

332
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:43,420
in parallel with ,um, beta...

333
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,781
beta times Re

334
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:50,350
For the sake of this example I assumed

335
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:56,129
a beta of 80. I don't know I did that, okay, I just did it

336
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,170
so what we're talking about is 1950

337
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,880
in parallel with 2250 in parallel with

338
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,310
I calculated it out 72 K becomes that resistor.

339
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,029
So when you add up all those in parallel

340
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:18,500
you get a whopping 1392 Ohms.

341
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,720
2 milliamps might not have been a very good choice.

342
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,679
a factor of 10 on that would bring me down like I said

343
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,060
to 500 microamps

344
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,779
which is much better in fact I recalculated

345
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:34,119
all that stuff and I ultimately got, you know, if you

346
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:37,569
if you assume this is 500 microamps these numbers change

347
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:42,730
to 7800 for that guy

348
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,620
and

349
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:47,799
and 10,200 for R2

350
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:50,930
and so your parallel input impedance

351
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:58,970
becomes about 40164

352
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,120
So about a factor of 3 better.

353
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,261
I can also drop my emitter current

354
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:05,984
this does not have to be 5 milliamps,

355
00:20:05,984 --> 00:20:09,050
I can drop it to like 1 milliamps and I could get this number

356
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:09,960
up even more

357
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,934
The source, whatever's coming out here, I don't wanna tax it

358
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:13,880
too very much

359
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,820
so the higher input impedance I get the better that's gonna be

360
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:21,189
the other thing is that cap, right?

361
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,120
once again 1/(2*pi*R*C)

362
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:28,789
equals f.
The higher this number is

363
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:31,980
the lower that cap value can be and it's easier to achieve

364
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,402
a lower value than a high-value in a lot of cases.

365
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:37,041
My output impedance is approximated,

366
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,808
 boy this is getting really nasty isn't it?

367
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:40,218
is approximated,

368
00:20:40,218 --> 00:20:49,611
Zout is about R source over beta. Okay? 

369
00:20:49,611 --> 00:20:54,308
so whatever the output impedance of this guy is divide that by beta

370
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:56,678
and that's what you can assume outta here.

371
00:20:56,678 --> 00:21:01,039
why would you use this circuit over an op amp or something else?

372
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,748
well you wouldn't necessarily.

373
00:21:02,848 --> 00:21:06,827
The two circuits that I've shown you so far are not very interesting to me

374
00:21:06,827 --> 00:21:08,439
The most interesting one

375
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,429
is going to come when we talk about common emitter, and

376
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:15,478
the reason you would use that one over an op amp,

377
00:21:15,478 --> 00:21:17,964
that one gives you voltage gain and current gain

378
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:20,916
and the reason you would use that one over an opamp

379
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:25,787
is because op amps are optimized for linearity

380
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:27,320
whereas the transistor

381
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,539
you try to work really hard to make it linear

382
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,829
which sounds like a downside, but it isn't always a downside

383
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:38,449
because it allows you to really jack with your signal in

384
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,102
really interesting ways, okay?

385
00:21:40,202 --> 00:21:42,449
You can add harmonics, you can do mixing

386
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:45,111
you can... it becomes kinda wacky,

387
00:21:45,111 --> 00:21:48,179
and the three configurations that I'm showing you are really

388
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:49,599
only the tip of the iceberg

389
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,639
they're just enough the little bit into it

390
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,089
and then cut you loose so fly from the nest and see what you do

391
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:57,389
That's it for this time

392
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,590
admittedly the first to common base and common collector

393
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:04,299
are mildly interesting but it's more to illustrate

394
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:08,190
the process of setting up a bias on a circuit so you can use it like that

395
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:08,842
the transistor
