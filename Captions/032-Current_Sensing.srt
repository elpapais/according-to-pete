00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,500
Hi, and welcome to the July
edition of According to Pete.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,925
Today, we're gonna talk about current sensing

4
00:00:16,025 --> 00:00:18,446
why you wanna do it
how you gonna do it

5
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:21,828
and at the end I'm gonna run you
through calibration

6
00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:24,589
of one of our current sensors that
we have available.

7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,573
So the reason why we do current
sensing is because 

8
00:00:27,673 --> 00:00:30,039
we, um, we we expect

9
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:32,556
a current to change in a certain
part of a circuit

10
00:00:32,656 --> 00:00:35,180
 or we need to make operational decisions

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,125
based on a what a circuit is doing

12
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:41,862
or we're afraid that something
is going to burn

13
00:00:41,862 --> 00:00:42,720
(this is usually my case).

14
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,298
I'm afraid something's going to burn

15
00:00:44,398 --> 00:00:46,600
and I wanna know if the
current is going up

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,689
in a certain section so
I can shut it off.

17
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:51,010
so there's a couple of different
ways to, uh,

18
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,129
to sense current in a circuit.

19
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:54,859
This, using Ohm's law

20
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:56,346
okay so suppose you got

21
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:58,112
something sitting out here

22
00:00:58,212 --> 00:01:00,619
that is, uh,  going to have
a varying in current you need to

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,750
know what it's going to do

24
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,079
right? Okay. So one method of

25
00:01:05,179 --> 00:01:07,074
sensing current is to actually place

26
00:01:07,074 --> 00:01:10,114
a resistance in series with your load

27
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:13,819
and ideally it's a very
small resistance, right?

28
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:16,120
And I'll explain that in a sec.

29
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,740
So typically you something like a
0.1 ohm resistor

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,340
and so as current changes in this thing

31
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,159
there is a really small little signal
that generates over this resistor

32
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,873
Okay. Really small,
kinda hard to read

33
00:01:30,973 --> 00:01:32,101
so what you typically do

34
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:36,675
is you take this to an
instrumentation amplifier

35
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:40,000
so I can op-amp and get a signal
in here

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,719
and another one there
nuh neh

37
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,829
and, um, and actually, I've
just cut to the chase

38
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:48,714
there's a few parts that do exactly this

39
00:01:48,814 --> 00:01:50,580
the INA169

40
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,232
and the reason it's a cool little part
is because when you set up

41
00:01:53,332 --> 00:01:55,623
an instrumentation amplifier like this

42
00:01:55,723 --> 00:01:58,429
you have a couple
resistances here, you needed

43
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,520
a little driver circuit

44
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,300
and goes to load and you
measure something else

45
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,702
the cool thing about this is that

46
00:02:06,802 --> 00:02:08,552
if you don't have a part 

47
00:02:08,552 --> 00:02:10,949
that's got all these things
on a single die

48
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,470
you end up with tolerances
that are really wiggy

49
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,397
but the, the guy in a 169 

50
00:02:15,497 --> 00:02:16,659
actually takes care
of this for you

51
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,490
it's kind of a cool part.

52
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,770
the problem with this

53
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,980
is that if you're sensing
a really large current

54
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:27,149
this resistor will create a much

55
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,925
larger voltage than
you might wanna have

56
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,629
between your load and ground

57
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:35,389
like for example 0.1 Ohm
resistor will generate

58
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,320
you know, at 10 Amps it'll
generate a Volt of noise

59
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,025
A lotta times that's not acceptable

60
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:44,969
OK, now something also cool and
I'll  write this down

61
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:47,989
INA169

62
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:50,592
another cool thing about this part is

63
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:52,129
it's a high side sensor

64
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:53,250
what that means is that

65
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,300
you don't haveto put
the resistor down here

66
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,239
on the low side

67
00:02:57,339 --> 00:02:59,119
you can put it up here

68
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:00,969
on the high side.

69
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:03,588
Now that's cool and all,
problem is this is still a

70
00:03:03,688 --> 00:03:08,110
series circuit, you're still going to
introduce noise to your load

71
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,140
Okay. But, since its a high-side sensor

72
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:13,666
what you can do

73
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:18,950
is you can put it
before your VREG

74
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:22,014
voltage regulator. Okay, voltage
regulators designed

75
00:03:22,014 --> 00:03:23,189
to take that noise out

76
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:25,584
so you can still sense what's
going on in your circuit

77
00:03:25,826 --> 00:03:28,069
without actually introducing
a whole bunch of noise

78
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:29,377
pretty cool, huh?

79
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:31,703
The other method of
doing this is, uh,

80
00:03:31,803 --> 00:03:32,661
by Hall Effect.

81
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:36,033
Basically any conductor that has
a current going through it 

82
00:03:36,145 --> 00:03:37,604
makes a magnetic field, right?

83
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:39,050
 and so we've got a sensor

84
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,590
that can sense that and I'll tell you
how much the magnetic fields doing

85
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,623
And blah blah blah blah.

86
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:47,020
We sell a part called the ACS712

87
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,708
and it is a Hall effect current sensor

88
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:51,651
The first cool thing

89
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:53,869
grab marker

90
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:57,949
where Ohm's Law related parts like
the INA169 are concerned

91
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:01,731
they're using a resistance ...
like ... .1 Ohm

92
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:05,099
which is a small resistance but
like I was saying before

93
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,716
at 10 amps is generating
a volt of noise

94
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:08,849
okay, and there's ways around it

95
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:12,638
this guy, comparatively, its in-line
resistance

96
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,670
is on the order of 1.2 milli Ohms

97
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,392
so in like two orders of
magnitude less

98
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,233
So the upshot of that

99
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,580
is you can use it on the low side
and it's not gonna generate

100
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,062
that much noise to your load, okay?

101
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:30,372
Second thing, the current path
through this device

102
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:34,436
is completely isolated
from the sensing circuit

103
00:04:34,536 --> 00:04:36,759
Right? So what that means

104
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,209
is you can also use it
on the high side

105
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:43,647
the reason you can't do, or why
high side sensing is difficult

106
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:45,680
is because you have this
common mode voltage

107
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,730
that is so different from the
supply voltage of the sensor

108
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,447
Right? and the INA169 allows
you to do this.

109
00:04:51,547 --> 00:04:56,350
It'll allow like sixty votes of higher
voltage from its supply voltage

110
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,122
and won't go wonky. Okay.

111
00:04:58,222 --> 00:05:00,883
This thing has an isolated
current path, so

112
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:03,702
you can use it on the low side,
you can use high side

113
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:06,851
it doesn't matter. You don't have
to use it in front of a regulator.

114
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:08,806
You can put this thing
pretty much anywhere.

115
00:05:08,906 --> 00:05:11,753
The third thing about this
that's cool 

116
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,110
at zero current through this

117
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,639
it will give you and output that is

118
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,790
VCC over two. Right?
Half of your supply voltage.

119
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,790
Right? So externally you're
powering this thing from 5 Volts

120
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,069
and it's got a ground, and then

121
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:31,552
a sense voltage over here

122
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:33,830
so if your power
in this thing with 5 volts

123
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,619
it'll give you an output of
two and a half Volts

124
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:38,500
when there's no current going through it

125
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,719
what does that mean?
That means it'll do

126
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:42,899
negative current as well
as positive current

127
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:45,274
so this part, the one,
the version that we sell

128
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:48,168
is the five Amp version it comes
in a few different versions

129
00:05:48,268 --> 00:05:51,439
The 5 Amp version has,
 and I got in my notes here

130
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:58,131
deflection of 185 milli Volts
at the output per Amp

131
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:00,870
that goes through this thing.
Now that's not

132
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,477
what I would call really great
resolution.

133
00:06:03,577 --> 00:06:05,450
A lot of currents that we deal with here

134
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:06,703
are small currents. Right?

135
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:09,587
We make a board
that's got this part this part

136
00:06:09,687 --> 00:06:11,909
plus a buffer amplifier with
some gain.

137
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:14,066
you can set the gain, and you
can set the reference voltage

138
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:14,979
and it works out pretty cool

139
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:24,452
that's SKU SEN08883

140
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:25,780
Point I wanna make

141
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:30,381
whether you using this thing
or you're using in the INA169

142
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:31,896
or other derivative

143
00:06:31,996 --> 00:06:33,929
you always want to
calibrate these things, right?

144
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:37,969
because, um, there are tolerances
there is some drift

145
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:39,668
you might have to deal with

146
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:42,485
there's probably some noise you
have to deal with

147
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:43,859
and I'll talk about that in a sec

148
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:47,031
so always wanna go through some
kinda calibration with these

149
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:50,778
you gotta know how much current
you're getting per

150
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,229
 millivolt of deflection.

151
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,381
Here we are again

152
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,960
I've got this hooked up
and this was my ADC example

153
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,462
from a couple months ago

154
00:06:57,562 --> 00:06:58,829
 the code is, oh,

155
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:01,394
I altered the code a little bit to
average out some of these readings.

156
00:07:01,494 --> 00:07:03,889
This thing can be noisy
so you are going to have to do a

157
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:05,509
little bit of averaging in code

158
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:06,879
makes it a lot easier to read something

159
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:09,073
and I've got this set up from
a power supply

160
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:12,243
and I've got it limited over there to
about 100 ish milliamps

161
00:07:12,343 --> 00:07:13,600
and I got my meter here

162
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,920
I'm using this as my calibration
standard

163
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,591
HAH! HAH! HAH!

164
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:21,129
I don't think this has ever been
calibrated since it left the factory

165
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:23,120
I've got my five Volt supply,
I've got ground

166
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,059
I got my sense line going to my ADC value

167
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:27,159
and it's spitting out here

168
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,160
this is the current

169
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,349
going through the meter coming
from my power supply over there

170
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,944
first thing you do set your reference
current to zero.

171
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:37,479
Once you know that it's
zero current, 0 current

172
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,710
you set the reference on this guy

173
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:43,939
and I apologize this being upside
down from where you're looking

174
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:46,185
There's 2 adjustments on this.
There's two pots

175
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:48,370
one says V ref one says gain

176
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,820
first thing you wanna to do is you
wanna set the V ref pot

177
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:55,054
and basically just set this assuming
you've got a set up like this

178
00:07:55,154 --> 00:07:56,919
or maybe you're reading it
with a voltmeter

179
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,340
you just wanna set it to the point

180
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,939
where you wanna start reading from so if

181
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,410
So if you wanna do

182
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,002
positive and negative current possibly 

183
00:08:05,102 --> 00:08:08,404
you'd set it for a halfway value
of your ADC

184
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:10,710
in this case were
running on a 10-bit ADC

185
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,811
on the breadboard

186
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:16,260
and so it's somewhere
around 512 or thereabouts

187
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,956
okay? That we get positive
and negative deflection

188
00:08:19,056 --> 00:08:21,139
so you set that,
and I sent this earlier

189
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:24,479
and it's right about 515, Eh

190
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,226
course enough,
doesn't have to be exact

191
00:08:26,326 --> 00:08:28,859
you also want to take note
of the value, right

192
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,190
so mark mark this down
and it's a little a little noisy

193
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,675
right? so you gotta kinda look at it
and go hmm, 530 ish or so

194
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,009
right that value down
then what you do you set

195
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:43,750
your current to the max value
that you wanna read

196
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,860
so if for example

197
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,709
you expect a circuit to be drawing
fifty milliamps

198
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:55,879
you might set your max current
on your current reference to

199
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:58,866
a hundred milliamps. Okay?
So you can see some

200
00:08:58,929 --> 00:08:59,929
some deflection there.

201
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:02,108
Hook that guy up
and my reference here

202
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,053
says I'm running about
102 milliamps

203
00:09:04,153 --> 00:09:05,260
so that's pretty close, right?

204
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,480
take note of that value then you set

205
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,840
the gain pot over here

206
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,120
this guy

207
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,064
to about as much deflection
as you want to read

208
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:17,719
or max deflection, right.

209
00:09:17,868 --> 00:09:19,409
So if you're going from

210
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:22,969
500 to whatever and
I'll tell you something

211
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,910
the op-amp buffer out here on
this board is an inverting opamp

212
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:30,149
so if you have positive going current

213
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:32,996
it's going to give you a
negative going pulse

214
00:09:33,096 --> 00:09:36,900
from your reference of
hundred-and-some ADC value.

215
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,440
Okay? So you adjust the gain pot

216
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,281
until you get, you know, a fairly
decent number that you can read

217
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,860
easily for your maximum
current deflection

218
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,784
That make sense?
So previously I adjusted this thing 

219
00:09:47,884 --> 00:09:52,563
and I'm getting about
three... fifty... three four

220
00:09:52,663 --> 00:09:56,019
in there someplace. Okay? So you
take note of that value

221
00:09:56,019 --> 00:10:00,250
then what you do is you set your
reference current to 0 again

222
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,919
so you disconnect it and you
double check that your VREF

223
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:08,469
ADC value is still steady. If it's not,
you gotta go back and do it again

224
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,889
um, and sometimes you know
your power supply can drift

225
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:13,129
[hesitant moaning]

226
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:14,893
we're ballparking here, come on.

227
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:17,808
Um,  I'm so you gotta watch,
that but this is just to verify

228
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:21,289
that you did it right, sort of sanity
check OK everything's still the same

229
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:22,396
we can move on now.

230
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:26,539
Then you have your maximum and
minimum current being zero

231
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,568
and a 102 milliamps and you have

232
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:34,269
uh, your ADC, Right. So I'm

233
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:38,135
what am i doing? I'm I'm defining
a line and it's a linear relationship

234
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:41,528
so I have I have my points and I
have my slope and I'm, yeah,

235
00:10:41,628 --> 00:10:43,778
basically I'm just figure out
the equation for a line

236
00:10:43,778 --> 00:10:47,429
Right? And so a earlier I had set this up

237
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:51,438
and I came out with a resolution
of about

238
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:57,090
0.56 milliamps per ADC division. Okay?

239
00:10:57,193 --> 00:11:00,149
So , you know, roughly about 500 microamps

240
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:02,436
not too bad and then once you
have that number

241
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,872
you just apply it in your code.
It's that simple.

242
00:11:04,972 --> 00:11:07,370
I will warn you that's

243
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,105
this, this is not, I mean we're we're
talking about

244
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:12,289
 millivolts worth of deflection here.

245
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:16,849
Okay? That's in the noise. So you're
gonna have to, like, for example

246
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,123
my, my code that I'm running on this thing

247
00:11:19,223 --> 00:11:20,838
I'm averaging it quite heavily.

248
00:11:20,938 --> 00:11:25,028
I mean I'm, I'm, averaging a
thousand ADC reads

249
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:29,563
um, and I'm getting updates roughly
about every hundred milliseconds

250
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,800
which is not too bad.

251
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,028
Will it do a higher frequency?
Yes it'll do higher frequency

252
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:37,948
but you're gonna have to, you know,
condition that in code

253
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,678
or maybe you wanna to put like

254
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:41,989
another cap on the output
of the op amp but

255
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:46,439
off the top of my head I can't
remember if the OPA344

256
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,558
which is the op amp in that, uh

257
00:11:48,558 --> 00:11:52,009
how steady it is for how much value
output capacitance.

258
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:53,204
You might wanna check that.

259
00:11:53,304 --> 00:11:55,328
I don't tell you anything that's a lie.

260
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:59,428
Ohh, I've got current! That's
low current sensor board.

261
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:03,419
I definitely don't want to steer you
away from the ah, ah

262
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:06,796
the Ohm's Law ones that use the
resistors we do sell a few those

263
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:10,698
you know they they are good parts,
um, but you know

264
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:12,997
they have their application just like
this one has application

265
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:14,249
and your mileage may vary.

266
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:17,777
Think about what you want and
then make a selection that's cool.

Keep the questions and comments
coming
